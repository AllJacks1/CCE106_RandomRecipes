# RandomRecipes
> Final Project for **CCE106 : 3189**

**RandomRecipes** simplifies the challenge of meal planning and decision fatigue when deciding what to cook. Whether you're craving something new or feeling unsure about your options, this platform provides an easy way to discover a wide variety of dishes. It empowers users to explore, save, and organize recipes based on personal preferences, prep time, and serving size.

Designed to inspire culinary creativity, RandomRecipes caters to any occasionâ€”whether you're planning a cozy dinner, a movie night, or a special date. Each recipe card includes essential details such as the dish name, total prep time, serving size, and a direct link to the full recipe. Users can effortlessly browse and save their favorite dishes for future reference.
